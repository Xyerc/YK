        <h1>My name is Yoshikage Kira.</h1>
        <p><em>Killer Queen's third bomb:<strong>Bites the dust</strong></em></p>
        <p>I'm 33 years old.
        My house is in the northeast section of Morioh,
        where all the villas are, and I am not married.
        I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department
        stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest.
        I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.I'm in bed by 11 PM,
        and make sure I get eight hours of
        sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk
        and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed,
        I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just
        like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in
        the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.
        I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life.
        I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing,
        that would cause me to lose sleep at night.
        That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.
        Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.</p>
